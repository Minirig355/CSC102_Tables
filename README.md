# CSC102 - TABLES

I added two new files:
- ./config/pages/schedule.html
- ./config/css/table.css

On this new page is a table showing the EDC '23 schedule. While the set times are accurate, the artists are filled by me, however it's all artists that would/have performed at EDC, some even there in '23, so I wouldn't consider this just a sample table.

I used some inline css for the small adjustments then used table.css to handle striping and such using the nth child method, I had to explicitly add a color to the table head otherwise it'd match the first row below it which looked weird.
